Helping advance software engineers into leadership and management roles.

# About Spark Academy

## For those about to rock...

### Welcome to Spark Academy!

What does it take to be an effective and impactful software engineering leader? The answer is continually evolving as the roles and responsibilities of the software team expand and become more strategic. While skills that used to set software engineering managers apart are still indispensable, today’s leaders are required to be more product and customer savvy. By the same token, they must be able to innovate with new technologies and methodologies at an accelerated pace and scale.

With the goal of advancing software engineers into tomorrow’s leadership and management roles, we have designed a series of seminars and workshops that capture essential principles and practical insights required for today’s software engineering leaders. These highly interactive sessions blend informative lectures and stimulating exercises covering critical competencies to help improve your effectiveness as a leader and increase your impact on complex software projects and digital transformation initiatives.
